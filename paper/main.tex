\begin{abstract}
We propose a geometric mechanism in four-dimensional teleparallel gravity (TEGR) that offers a unified perspective on fermionic statistics, chirality, and the near-critical binding of composite states. We consider spacetime containing microscopic handles of topology $S^2\times S^1$, carrying an integer torsional monopole charge $q$. Using a ``Spinning SU(2)'' tetrad ansatz, we derive three interconnected results.

(i) \textbf{Stability:} The pure TEGR sector admits a classically stable handle radius with an on-shell energy $E \simeq \alpha |q|$, providing a parity-even geometric mass term.
(ii) \textbf{Chirality:} The Nieh--Yan boundary term produces a parity-odd contribution to the effective action. A slow precession mode develops a chiral tilt whose direction is locked to the sign of $q$, acting as a geometric mechanism for chirality selection. This construction is motivated by the known connection between the Nieh--Yan invariant and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms that govern particle statistics in Skyrmion-like models.
(iii) \textbf{Critical binding:} The stiffness of the precession mode scales as $k(q) \propto \omega^2 |q|$, placing the system at a classical critical point where the binding energy per unit charge is independent of $q$ to leading order.

Consequently, subleading corrections can render composite states with $|q| \ge 2$ (in particular $|q|=3$) energetically competitive with separated unit-charge handles. These results demonstrate that the interplay of torsion and the Nieh--Yan invariant can simultaneously generate a $|q|$-proportional mass scale, a $q$-dependent chiral bias, and near-critical binding of composite configurations from spacetime geometry alone, within a teleparallel toy model of microscopic handles.

The name simultaneously reflects the microscopic handle geometry that emerged
somewhat serendipitously in early discussions, and the joyful, almost trembling
excitement that accompanied each small breakthrough.
